## The End of Night Sweats

If you're a hot sleeper, you know the struggle. You wake up in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, kicking off the covers, and desperately trying to find the cool side of the pillow. Poor temperature regulation is one of the biggest culprits behind fragmented, low-quality sleep.

The problem is that many modern mattresses, especially those made of memory foam, are notorious for trapping body heat. This creates a "heat island" effect that prevents your core body temperature from dropping, which is essential for deep sleep.

But what if your mattress could actively work to keep you cool all night long? Welcome to the world of cooling mattresses.

## How We Tested

We didn't just read reviews; we put these mattresses to the test. Our team of hot sleepers spent over 300 hours testing the top cooling mattresses on the market. We measured temperature regulation, pressure relief, motion isolation, and overall comfort to find the absolute best options for every type of sleeper.

## Beyond the Mattress: Other Cooling Solutions

While a cooling mattress is the foundation of a cool sleep environment, these other tools can take your temperature regulation to the next level:

- **Cooling Mattress Toppers:** A great option if you're not ready to invest in a new mattress. Look for toppers made of latex or infused with gel or copper.

By investing in a cooling mattress and creating a sleep environment that promotes temperature regulation, you can finally put an end to night sweats and start getting the deep, restorative sleep you deserve.
